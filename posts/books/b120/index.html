Review 4.5/5
Thoughts I thought this book was great. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively short read and for those interested in a sci-fi thriller this is a must read. The story kept me hooked and every time you thought you knew what was going on, a whole new twist appears. For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t read in a while and would like to get back, I highly recommend this book."/>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>
I thought this book was great. It&rsquo;s a relatively short read and for those interested in a sci-fi thriller this is a must read. The story kept me hooked and every time you thought you knew what was going on, a whole new twist appears. For those who haven&rsquo;t read in a while and would like to get back, I highly recommend this <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion">book.</a></p>
<p><strong>My Takeaways</strong>
Although fictional, I found one important takeaway from this book.</p>
<p>Never dwell in the past, enjoy the present. Those diagnosed with FMS indulge in their memories to the point of suicide just because their false memories depict a much happier life. Had they just focused on the moment and lived here and now, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been so deeply effected.</p>
