Mission • To Experiment, Document, and Augment
16 years old and still developing, my brain is in a rapid state of growth as I approach adulthood. I wanted to start this website because I believe that in this modern era, people unknowingly overstimulate themselves as they indulge in technological advancements primarily in entertainment. Our primitive lymbic system loves the binging and distracing as it&amp;rsquo;s primary purpose is to simply keep us alive."/>

<p><strong>Mission</strong> • To Experiment, Document, and Augment</p>
<p>16 years old and still developing, my brain is in a rapid state of growth as I approach adulthood. I wanted to start this website because I believe that in this modern era, people unknowingly overstimulate themselves as they indulge in technological advancements primarily in entertainment. Our primitive lymbic system loves the binging and distracing as it&rsquo;s primary purpose is to simply keep us alive. The rational mind tells us that one more episode should only mean one last episode but sometimes we can&rsquo;t help but say that ten sounds better. We are a complex machine with our brain serving as the most powerful processer with over eighty-six billion neurons. We have the ability to adapt like no other creature and yet so many people avoid the idea of self development. I decided that I would use this website as a journal through my various self experiments as I attempt to improve myself.</p>
