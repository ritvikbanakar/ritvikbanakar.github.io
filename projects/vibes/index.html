      <p>Check out our video presentation to the City Council Of Cupertino by clicking <a href="https://youtu.be/bh3Iw5BRZRQ?t=849">here</a>. This program won first at Hack Cupertino 2018, a city held hackthon. This project was one that was inspired by an interesting observation. Essentially, while listening to a sad Indian song I hypothesized that people that are depressed often listen to depressing/sad music as well. Through further research with the internet it turns out that my hypothesis was in fact correct. Armed with this knowledge, my team and I decided to create an application that would, once granted permission, take a look at your Spotify listening history. Then, using artifical intelligence, our program would decide if each of your last 50 songs were sad or happy using attributes such as the tempo and pitch of the song. It would then conclude whether the user seemed to be depressed or not. In the case that the user was depressed, the application would then sugguest a happier playlist to the user.</p>
