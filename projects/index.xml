      <description>This application was created in order to connect the KKNC community together. KKNC is a non profit organization focused on bringing Indian culture (specifically from Karnataka) to the Bay Area. For this application, I helped bring in ideas pertaining to how the app could appease younger children as well as older adults. In addition, I helped debug the application on both the iOS and Android platform. The special thing about this project is that even today there are thousands of people using it to connect with each other and with the KKNC events.</description>

      <description>This program won third at Paly Hacks 2018, a hackathon hosted by Palo Alto High School. The app allows citizens to post reports to a specialized community stream. From the stream, city council members will be able to directly communicate to citizens who have posted the report. The citizens will be able to check the condition of the problem at hand as the council member works to resolve it. City Council and other authorized members will also be able to submit important news updates that pose an immediate threat to the community.</description>

      <description>This program won 1st in the crypto category at Angel Hacks 2019. This app allowed users to be incentivized to help one another in the programming community. With forums such as Stack Overflow, our team recognized that people do not have the drive and passion to answer questions accurately. We decided to create an application in which people could help one another, and be rewarded for doing a good job assisting.</description>

      <description>Check out our video presentation to the City Council Of Cupertino by clicking here. This program won first at Hack Cupertino 2018, a city hosted hackthon. This project was one that was inspired by an interesting observation. Essentially, while listening to a sad Indian song I hypothesized that people that are depressed often listen to depressing/sad music as well. Through further research with the internet it turns out that my hypothesis was in fact correct.</description>
