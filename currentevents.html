<a name="db">Genetic engineering has helped create many drugs and hormones for medical use. An example this is getting the insulin gene for diabetic patients. We were struggling with the fact that some patients with diabetes are experiencing allergic reactions to the insulin from cows and pigs. The obvious solution is to give patients human insulin rather than cow or pig. Injecting patients with purified human protein should reduce the risks of a reaction, but purifying insulin from human tissue is impractical. That's why animal insulin was being used. Using genetic engineering we were able to open the door to mass producing insulin rather than purifying it from animal tissue. Scientists use a virus that basically serves as a biological syringe to inject DNA into the host cell. Normally, this injected DNA would lead to a viral infection but since it is genetically-engineered viral vector it is designed to inject only the DNA of interest. </p>

Through genetic engineering we have been able to exploit diseases and improve insects and pest resistance mechanisms efficiently. Various genes that help build resistance have been found, cloned, and placed into another species. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacteria that can destroy the stem borer pest in rice and maize. Looking at this scientists took the Bt gene and cloned and then placed it into the rice or maize genome. As a result, rice or maize showed resistance again stem-borer pests as it had the Bt gene. Using genetic engineering we have been able to improve the resistance for many plants but is it healthy for us?</p>
