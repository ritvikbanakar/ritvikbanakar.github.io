This program won 1st in the crypto category at Angel Hacks 2019. This app allowed users to be incentivized to help one another in the programming community. With forums such as Stack Overflow, our team recognized that people do not have the drive and passion to answer questions accurately. We decided to create an application in which people could help one another, and be rewarded for doing a good job assisting. For this project, I mainly worked on the web application using the Waves Wallet API. Due to struggles in the Waves Wallet iOS SDK, we allowed our application to conduct transactions through our website. â€¢ [Github](https://devpost.com/software/safe-city)
