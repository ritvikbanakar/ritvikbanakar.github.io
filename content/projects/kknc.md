This application was created in order to connect the KKNC community together. KKNC is a non profit organization focused on bringing Indian culture (specifically from Karnataka) to the Bay Area. For this application, I helped bring in ideas pertaining to how the app could appease younger children as well as older adults. In addition, I helped debug the application on both the iOS and Android platform. The special thing about this project is that even today there are thousands of people using it to connect with each other and with the KKNC events.
