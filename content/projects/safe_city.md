This program won third at Paly Hacks 2018, a hackathon hosted by Palo Alto High School. The app allows citizens to post reports to a specialized community stream. From the stream, city council members will be able to directly communicate to citizens who have posted the report. The citizens will be able to check the condition of the problem at hand as the council member works to resolve it. City Council and other authorized members will also be able to submit important news updates that pose an immediate threat to the community. For this project, I mainly worked on the basic application using Swift and Firebase. I implemented Firebase to create users and posts that would trasfer over multiple devices â€¢ [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/safe-city)
