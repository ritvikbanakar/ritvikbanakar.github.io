Book 2
**Finished** May 2020

**Review** 2/5

**Thoughts**
Dale Carnegie's book follows a very simple structure of lesson, example, and finally reiteration of said lesson. I think that at first, the book was intriguing but after I had completed about a third of the book it began getting boring as it felt very repetitive. The numerous examples began having predictable outcomes and the lessons just felt dated as nowadays, many of his "rules" are just common sense. I would say this book is a pass as most of the online summaries can provide you with all the lessons minus the boredom.

**My Takeaways**
As stated above, I felt that most of these lessons were just common sense but anyways

To make people like you:
1. Be genuinely interested in the other person
2. Smile at others
3. A person's name is the sweetest sound to their ears
4. Listen to the other person
5. Talk to them in terms of their interests
6. Sincerely make the other person feel important
