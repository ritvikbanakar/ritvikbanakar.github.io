Book 3
**Started & Finished** June 3rd 2020

**Review** 4/5

**Thoughts**
Similar to Recursion, Dark Matter is yet another sci-fi thriller. Although the plot was slightly less convoluting, I felt a stronger connection to each of the characters. This book is a fun read and I recommend it for anyone interested in science fiction and mystery. Revolving on the idea of regret, the book provides a unique take on those moments when we wonder what if...

**My Takeaways**
This book taught me that you will always have those what if moments where you ponder what would happen if you did things differently. Understand that there is no point in having regrets because those what if moments will ALWAYS seem better because they aren't the present. Your mind will tell you that things would have been better if you just did this one thing but there is NO way of positively knowing that. The butterfly effect and unintended consequences insure that we don't know the exact outcome of our choices until they happen. Be grateful for what you have and don't dwell on what you could potentially have had.
