Book 1
**Started & Finished** May 7th 2020

**Review** 4.5/5

**Thoughts**
I thought this book was great. It's a relatively short read and for those interested in a sci-fi thriller this is a must read. The story kept me hooked and every time you thought you knew what was going on, a whole new twist appears. For those who haven't read in a while and would like to get back, I highly recommend this [book.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion)

**My Takeaways**
Although fictional, I found one important takeaway from this book.

Never dwell in the past, enjoy the present. Those diagnosed with FMS indulge in their memories to the point of suicide just because their false memories depict a much happier life. Had they just focused on the moment and lived here and now, they wouldn't have been so deeply effected.
