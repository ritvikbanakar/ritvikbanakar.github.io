**Goal One** Read 52 books in 2020

Write a brief summary and takeaway for each book.

**Why?** Books are an incredible dense source of material in which through active engagement, one can understand decades worth of research. Through my summaries and takeaways I hope to encourage others to read more and learn a few lessons along the way :)
