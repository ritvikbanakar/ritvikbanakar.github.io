      <description>What is the point of this?
Mission • To Experiment, Document, and Augment
16 years old and still developing, my brain is in a rapid state of growth as I approach adulthood. I wanted to start this website because I believe that in this modern era, people unknowingly overstimulate themselves as they indulge in technological advancements primarily in entertainment. Our primitive lymbic system loves the binging and distracing as it&amp;rsquo;s primary purpose is to simply keep us alive.</description>

      <description>Check out our video presentation to the City Council Of Cupertino by clicking here. This program won first at Hack Cupertino 2018, a city held hackthon. This project was one that was inspired by an interesting observation. Essentially, while listening to a sad Indian song I hypothesized that people that are depressed often listen to depressing/sad music as well. Through further research with the internet it turns out that my hypothesis was in fact correct.</description>
