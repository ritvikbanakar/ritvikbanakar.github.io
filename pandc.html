    <p><a name="p">Genetic engineering is a revolutionary advancement in technology for many reasons. Using genetic engineering we could wipe out many of the most deadly and difficult diseases. In fact there are a number of genetic mutation problems that will probably never be ended unless we step in and genetically engineer the next generation to be able to withstand these problems. For example a progressive and dangerous disease known as Cystic Fibrosis currently has no known cure but it could be completely cured with the help of selective genetic engineering. 

There are many problems that we can detect even before children are born. For example in the womb, doctors can tell if a baby is going to suffer from sickle cell anemia. However, with genetic engineering we no longer have to worry. One of the benefits of genetic engineering is that it can cure diseases and illness in unborn children. This means all children would be able to be born healthy and strong. Genetic engineering would also help reduce the risk of passing on diseases to their children.</p>

    <p><a name="c">Genetic engineering may be amazing but it isn't completely safe. A major problem with genetic engineering is the safety of making changes at the cellular level. Scientists do not yet know everything about the human body and how it works on the cellular level. How can they possible understand the consequences of little changes made at the smallest level. What if we wipe out a disease only to bring something brand new and even worse. The human body is so complicated that scientists have to be able to predict what sort of affects their actions will have and they just can’t account for everything that could go wrong. Another problem with genetic engineering is that it will limit genetic diversity. We need diversity in all species or we could have another Great Famine. The Great Famine started in the early 19th century when a strain of Phytophthora accidentally arrived from North America. It rotted a lot of the year’s potatoes. That partial crop failure was followed by much more devastating failures in 1846 - 1849. </p>
