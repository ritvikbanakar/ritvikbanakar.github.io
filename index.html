        <p><a name="dna"> Genetic Engineering is the process of adding DNA to an organism to add traits to it. Some examples of genetic engineering are plants that have resistant to insects, plants that can tolerate pesticides that are meant to kill weeds, and crops with modified oil content. 
Before you can understand how genetic engineering works you first need to understand a few DNA concepts. A gene is a small segment of DNA and each gene has a instruction to a single protein. DNA is simply the recipe for life. Each gene has a combination of subunits that spell out how to make that certain protein. These subunits are made of the letters A, T, G, and C. Proteins do the work in cells. The set of genes are called a genome. Every cell of a living organism has a genome. 
     DNA is special as it not only is the recipe to live but also because it is a ‘universal language’, meaning the genetic code is applied the same way in all organisms. This is important because when a gene is taken from one organism and inserted into another the recipient organism can read and apply that trait.</p>

     <BR></BR> <p><a name="ge"> Genetic engineering works by physically removing a gene from one organism and inserting to another. This process gives that target organism the trait from the other organism. 
    First, pick an organism that naturally contains that trait. Then extract the DNA from that organism. Then you pick the one desired gene and copy it. Then the gene can be slightly modified to work in a desirable way once in the recipient organism. The new gene called a transgene is delivered into the recipient organism. This is known as a transformation. A common transformation technique is to use a bacteria which delivers the transgene into the cells of the organism. Another technique shoots microscopic gold particles which contain the transgene into the cells of the recipient organism. Both techniques give the engineer no control over where or if the transgene inserts the genome. As a result, engineers must try hundreds of times to achieve just a few transgenic organisms. 
     Once a transgenic organism has been created, engineers use traditional breeding to improve the characteristics of the final product. Genetic engineering doesn't truly eliminate traditional breeding as it is just a way to add new traits to an organism.
